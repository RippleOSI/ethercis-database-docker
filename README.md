# ethercis-database-docker
A customised version of PostgreSQL for use as persistence in the Ripple Stack Docker-Compose setup.
The actual EtherCIS Clinical Data Repository is also dockerised and you will need both to have a working setup.

Prebuilt docker images for both are available on the Docker Hub
